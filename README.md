# ProjectBoost3D
Unity and C# learning project

The goal of this project is to move the rocket from the blue launch pad to the green landing pad without hitting any of the obstacles.
In case one of the obstacles is hit, the game restarts. Otherwise, the player goes to the next level. In order to play, we must use the keys "A" to move the rocket to the left, "D" to move the rocket to the right, and "Space" to boost the rocket up.

Two levels were developed to practice some basic functionalities from Unity and C# such as the features and methods listed below: 
><p>AddRelativeForce()</p>
><p>Transform.Rotate()</p>
><p>Rigidbody Constraints</p>
><p>Audio Introduction</p>
><p>Multiple Audio Clips</p>
><p>Particles</p>
><p>Lights</p>
><p>Move obstacle with code</p>
><p>Mathf.Sin() for Oscillation</p>
><p>Quit application</p>
><p>Build and Publish a game</p>

This is a demonstration of a player successfully completing the first level, called "Mars":

This is a demonstration of a player failing to complete the second level, thus having to restart the level "Moon":
